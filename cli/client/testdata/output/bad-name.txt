Could not reach the service scheduler with name 'hello-world-1'.
Possible causes:
- Did you provide the correct service name? Specify a service name with '--name=<name>', or with 'dcos config set hello-world.service_name <name>'.
- Was the service recently installed or updated? It may still be initializing, wait a bit and try again.
